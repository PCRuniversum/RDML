  Abstract                 = {Background: Currently, a lack of consensus exists on how best to perform and interpret quantitative real-time {PCR} ({qPCR}) experiments. The problem is exacerbated by a lack of sufficient experimental detail in many publications, which impedes a reader’s ability to evaluate critically the quality of the results presented or to repeat the experiments.
Content: The Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time {PCR} Experiments ({MIQE}) guidelines target the reliability of results to help ensure the integrity of the scientific literature, promote consistency between laboratories, and increase experimental transparency. {MIQE} is a set of guidelines that describe the minimum information necessary for evaluating {qPCR} experiments. Included is a checklist to accompany the initial submission of a manuscript to the publisher. By providing all relevant experimental conditions and assay characteristics, reviewers can assess the validity of the protocols used. Full disclosure of all reagents, sequences, and analysis methods is necessary to enable other investigators to reproduce results. {MIQE} details should be published either in abbreviated form or as an online supplement.
Summary: Following these guidelines will encourage better experimental practice, allowing more reliable and unequivocal interpretation of {qPCR} results.},

  Abstract                 = {There is growing interest in digital {PCR} ({dPCR)} because 
technological progress makes it a practical and increasingly affordable 
technology. {dPCR} allows the precise quantification of nucleic acids, 
facilitating the measurement of small percentage differences and quantification 
of rare variants. {dPCR} may also be more reproducible and less susceptible to 
inhibition than quantitative real-time {PCR} ({qPCR).} Consequently, {dPCR} has 
the potential to have a substantial impact on research as well as diagnostic 
applications. However, as with {qPCR}, the ability to perform robust meaningful 
experiments requires careful design and adequate controls. To assist 
independent 
evaluation of experimental data, comprehensive disclosure of all relevant 
experimental details is required. To facilitate this process we present the 
Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Digital {PCR} Experiments 
guidelines. This report addresses known requirements for {dPCR} that have 
already been identified during this early stage of its development and 
commercial implementation. Adoption of these guidelines by the scientific 
community will help to standardize experimental protocols, maximize efficient 
utilization of resources, and enhance the impact of this promising new 
technology.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: Recent progress in live-cell imaging and modeling techniques has resulted in generation of a large amount of quantitative data (from experimental measurements and computer simulations) on spatiotemporal dynamics of biological objects such as molecules, cells and organisms. Although many research groups have independently dedicated their efforts to developing software tools for visualizing and analyzing these data, these tools are often not compatible with each other because of different data formats.
Results: We developed an open unified format, Biological Dynamics Markup Language (BDML; current version: 0.2), which provides a basic framework for representing quantitative biological dynamics data for objects ranging from molecules to cells to organisms. BDML is based on Extensible Markup Language (XML). Its advantages are machine and human readability and extensibility. BDML will improve the efficiency of development and evaluation of software tools for data visualization and analysis.

This arises because the relational databases used in genomic research are difficult to adapt to rapidly evolving experimental designs, data formats and analytic algorithms. Here we describe an adaptive approach to managing experimental data based on semantically typed data hypercubes (SDCubes) that combine hierarchical data format 5 (HDF5) and extensible markup language (XML) file types. We demonstrate the application of SDCube-based storage using ImageRail, a software package for high-throughput microscopy. Experimental design and its day-to-day evolution, not rigid standards, determine how ImageRail data are organized in SDCubes. We applied ImageRail to collect and analyze drug dose-response landscapes in human cell lines at single-cell resolution.},

  Abstract                 = {Real-time quantitative polymerase-chain-reaction (qPCR) is a standard technique in most laboratories used for various applications in basic research. Analysis of qPCR data is a crucial part of the entire experiment, which has led to the development of a plethora of methods. The released tools either cover specific parts of the workflow or provide complete analysis solutions.

Here, we surveyed 27 open-access software packages and tools for the analysis of qPCR data. The survey includes 8 Microsoft Windows, 5 web-based, 9 R-based and 5 tools from other platforms. Reviewed packages and tools support the analysis of different qPCR applications, such as RNA quantification, DNA methylation, genotyping, identification of copy number variations, and digital PCR. We report an overview of the functionality, features and specific requirements of the individual software tools, such as data exchange formats, availability of a graphical user interface, included procedures for graphical data presentation, and offered statistical methods. In addition, we provide an overview about quantification strategies, and report various applications of qPCR.

Our comprehensive survey showed that most tools use their own file format and only a fraction of the currently existing tools support the standardized data exchange format RDML. To allow a more streamlined and comparable analysis of qPCR data, more vendors and tools need to adapt the standardized format to encourage the exchange of data between instrument software, analysis tools, and researchers.},

Due to the discovery of new molecules and new emerging bioanalytical problems, there is an ongoing demand for a technology platform that provides a broad range of assays with a user-friendly flexibility and rapid adaptability to new applications. Here we describe a highly versatile microscopy platform, {VideoScan}, for the rapid and simultaneous analysis of various assay formats based on fluorescence microscopic detection. The technological design is equally suitable for assays in solution, microbead-based assays and cell pattern recognition. The multiplex real-time capability for tracking of changes under dynamic heating conditions makes it a useful tool for {PCR} applications and nucleic acid hybridization, enabling kinetic data acquisition impossible to obtain by other technologies using endpoint detection. The paper discusses the technological principle of the platform regarding data acquisition and processing. Microbead-based and solution applications for the detection of diverse biomolecules, including antigens, antibodies, peptides, oligonucleotides and amplicons in small reaction volumes, are presented together with a high-content detection of autoimmune antibodies using a {HEp}-2 cell assay. Its adaptiveness and versatility gives {VideoScan} a competitive edge over other bioanalytical technologies.},

Genotyping of most variants is possible by the melting temperature of the {PCR} products, while all variants can be genotyped with unlabeled probes. Mutation scanning and sequence matching depend on sequence differences that result in heteroduplexes that change the shape of the melting curve. High-resolution {DNA} melting has several advantages over other genotyping and scanning methods, including an inexpensive closed tube format that is homogenous, accurate and rapid. Owing to its simplicity and speed, the method is a good fit for personalized medicine as a rapid, inexpensive method to predict therapeutic response.},

correction. A {PCR} efficiency value can be derived from the relative increase 
in fluorescence in the exponential phase of the amplification curve for all

This is especially true for the handling of the fluorescence baseline. This article shows that baseline estimation errors are directly reflected in the observed PCR efficiency values and are thus propagated exponentially in the estimated starting concentrations as well as 'fold-difference' results. Because of the unknown origin and kinetics of the baseline fluorescence, the fluorescence values monitored in the initial cycles of the PCR reaction cannot be used to estimate a useful baseline value. An algorithm that estimates the baseline by reconstructing the log-linear phase downward from the early plateau phase of the PCR reaction was developed and shown to lead to very reproducible PCR efficiency values. PCR efficiency values were determined per sample by fitting a regression line to a subset of data points in the log-linear phase. The variability, as well as the bias, in qPCR results was significantly reduced when the mean of these PCR efficiencies per amplicon was used in the calculation of an estimate of the starting concentration per sample.},

  Abstract                 = {Myosin light chain-2 (MYL2, also called MLC-2) is an {\textasciitilde} 19 kDa sarcomeric protein that belongs to the EF-hand calcium binding protein superfamily and exists as three major isoforms encoded by three distinct genes in mammalian striated muscle. Each of the three different MLC-2 genes (MLC-2f; fast twitch skeletal isoform, MLC-2v; cardiac ventricular and slow twitch skeletal isoform, MLC-2a; cardiac atrial isoform) has a distinct developmental expression pattern in mammals. Genetic loss-of-function studies in mice demonstrated an essential role for cardiac isoforms of MLC-2, MLC-2v and MLC-2a, in cardiac contractile function during early embryogenesis. In the adult heart, MLC-2v function is regulated by phosphorylation, which displays a specific 1`expression pattern (high in epicardium and low in endocardium) across the heart. These data along with new data from computational models, genetic mouse models, and human studies have revealed a direct role for MLC-2v phosphorylation in cross-bridge cycling kinetics, calcium-dependent cardiac muscle contraction, cardiac torsion, cardiac function and various cardiac diseases. This review focuses on the regulatory functions of MLC-2 in the embryonic and adult heart, with an emphasis on phosphorylation-driven actions of MLC-2v in adult cardiac muscle, which provide new insights into mechanisms regulating myosin cycling kinetics and human cardiac diseases.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: Quantification cycle (Cq) and amplification efficiency ({AE}) are parameters mathematically extracted from raw data to characterize quantitative {PCR} ({qPCR}) reactions and quantify the copy number in a sample. Little attention has been paid to the effects of preprocessing and the use of smoothing or filtering approaches to compensate for noisy data. Existing algorithms largely are taken for granted, and it is unclear which of the various methods is most informative. We investigated the effect of smoothing and filtering algorithms on amplification curve data.
Methods: We obtained published high-replicate {qPCR} datasets from standard block thermocyclers and other cycler platforms and statistically evaluated the impact of smoothing on Cq and {AE}.
Results: Our results indicate that selected smoothing algorithms affect estimates of Cq and {AE} considerably. The commonly used moving average filter performed worst in all {qPCR} scenarios. The Savitzky–Golay smoother, cubic splines, and Whittaker smoother resulted overall in the least bias in our setting and exhibited low sensitivity to differences in {qPCR} {AE}, whereas other smoothers, such as running mean, introduced an {AE}-dependent bias.
Conclusions: The selection of a smoothing algorithm is an important step in developing data analysis pipelines for real-time {PCR} experiments. We offer guidelines for selection of an appropriate smoothing algorithm in diagnostic {qPCR} applications. The findings of our study were implemented in the R packages {chipPCR} and {qpcR} as a basis for the implementation of an analytical strategy.},

  Abstract                 = {Here we present {Primer3Plus}, a new web interface to the popular Primer3 primer design program as an enhanced alternative for the {CGI}- scripts that come with Primer3. Primer3 consists of a command line program and a web interface. The web interface is one large form showing all of the possible options. This makes the interface powerful, but at the same time confusing for occasional users. Primer3Plus provides an intuitive user interface using present-day web technologies and has been developed in close collaboration with molecular biologists and technicians regularly designing primers. It focuses on the task at hand, and hides detailed settings from the user until these are needed. We also added functionality to automate specific tasks like designing primers for cloning or step-wise sequencing. Settings and designed primer sequences can be stored locally for later use. Primer3Plus supports a range of common sequence formats, such as {FASTA}. Finally, primers selected by Primer3Plus can be sent to an order form, allowing tight integration into laboratory ordering systems. Moreover, the open architecture of Primer3Plus allows easy expansion or integration of external software packages. The Primer3Plus Perl source code is available under {GPL} license from {SourceForge}. Primer3Plus is available at http://www.bioinformatics.nl/primer3plus.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent advances in fluorescent dyes, methods, instruments and software for {DNA} melting analysis have created versatile new tools for variant scanning and genotyping. High resolution melting analysis ({HRM} or {HRMA}) is faster, simpler, and less expensive than alternative approaches requiring separations or labeled probes. With the addition of a saturating dye before {PCR} followed by rapid melting analysis of the {PCR} products, the sensitivity of heterozygote scanning approaches 100\%. Specificity can be increased by identifying common polymorphisms with small amplicon melting, unlabeled probes or snapback primers to decrease the sequencing burden. However, some homozygotes require mixing for identification. Furthermore, different heterozygotes may produce melting curves so similar to each other that, although they clearly vary from homozygous variants, they are not differentiated from each other. Nevertheless, the experimental return for minimal effort is great. This focus issue of Human Mutation includes a concise, timely review on high resolution melting, a comparison to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, integration with {qPCR} for copy number assessment, combined amplicon scanning and unlabeled probe genotyping from a single melting curve, and applications to the mitochondrial genome and to {BRCA}1.
